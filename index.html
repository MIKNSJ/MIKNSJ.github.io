                Section. 3.
                The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators
                from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years;
                and each Senator shall have one Vote.
                
                Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the
                first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into
                three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall
                be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second
                Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class
                at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be
                chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation,
                or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State,
                the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the
                next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such
                Vacancies.
                
                No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the
                Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United
                States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that
                State for which he shall be chosen.
                
                The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the
                Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.
                
                The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President
                pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he
                shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.
                
                The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments.
                When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or
                Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried,
                the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted
                without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.
                
                Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to
                removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any
                Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the
                Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to
                Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.
